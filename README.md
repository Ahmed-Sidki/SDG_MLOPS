A mini-project designed for individuals interested in building an MLOps pipeline using open-source tools and technologies such as MLflow, Airflow, MinIO (AWS-compatible object storage), and PostgreSQL.

Feel to explore how to integrate these tools into a scalable and efficient machine learning operations workflow.
